# **Currency Converter**

## **Overview**

This project is a currency converter built using **React**. It is a demonstration of my learning journey with React, including React hooks, components, and custom hooks.

Another version of a currency converter is available on my GitHub profile, which was created using plain **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. However, this project takes a step further, utilizing React's capabilities to build a more robust and dynamic application.

## **Features**

- **React Hooks**: This project explores various React hooks like:
  - `useState`
  - `useEffect`
  - `useId`
- **Custom Hooks**: I created a custom hook to handle API requests, improving code reusability and readability.
- **Reusable Components**: Components are modularly built and used within the root file, showcasing my understanding of React's component-based architecture.
